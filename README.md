<h1>ðŸš™EPA Fuel Economy </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Fuel Economy Tracker built using JavaFX, with MVC architecture. The View initializes the UI and manages scene transitions, the Controller acts as a bridge between the UI and data, and the Model handles data persistence and logic. Vehicles' data is loaded from a CSV or binary file and can be added, removed, or filtered based on criteria like MPG or fuel costs. The application ensures data persistence by saving updates to a binary file upon exit. It supports sorting and distinct vehicle make filtering for better usability.
